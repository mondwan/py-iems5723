The pan-democratic lawmakers' first offensive - a motion raised by the Labour Party's Lee Cheuk-yan to adjourn the Finance Committee's first meeting since the summer break - was, however, defeated by the pro-establishment camp in a vote after a heated debate.

The pan-democrats then changed tack by delaying individual funding items - the first being for a food-waste treatment facility - with People Power's Chan Chi-chuen tabling an adjournment motion.

Pro-government lawmakers blocked that motion in another vote.

The Finance Committee was meeting yesterday to discuss 18 items carried over from its last session before the summer break, which had been marred by filibustering.

Topping its agenda were five separate requests for funding for waste infrastructure, including landfill extensions and a plan to build an incinerator.

At the end of the four-hour meeting, no decisions had been reached on any of the items put to a vote, as lawmakers still had questions to raise.
